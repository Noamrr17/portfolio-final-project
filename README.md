Portfolio Project
Welcome to my portfolio project! This project showcases my skills in front-end web development using HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and API. Below you will find details about the project and instructions on how to view and run it.

Technologies Used
HTML: The backbone of the web pages, providing the structure and content.
CSS: Used for styling the HTML elements to create visually appealing layouts.
SASS: A CSS pre-processor that allows for variables, nested rules, and more efficient stylesheets. (Used in Project 6)
Bootstrap: A popular front-end framework that provides responsive design and pre-styled components. (Used in Project 5)
JavaScript: New 7 projects with javascript technology are added into my portfolio project.
API (Application Programming Interface): An application programming interface is a set of ready-made code libraries, commands, functions, and procedures that programmers can easily use without having to write them themselves
so that they can use the application information they want to use for their application. (Used in Weather App)
